# Deep learning in Computer Vision

Welcome to the Deep Learning in Computer Vision Projects repository! This collection of projects is a collaborative effort guided by the expertise of Professor Yong Jae Lee, focusing on various computer vision concepts and implementations in Python, primarily presented as Jupyter notebooks.

Here are the topics for each project:
* K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm
* Linear Classifier
* Fully Connected Networks
* Convolutional Networks
* FCOS: Fully Convolutional One-stage Object Detection
* Generative Adversarial Networks
* Style Transfer with SqueezeNet-based Diffusion Model
