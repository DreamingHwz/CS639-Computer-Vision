# CS639-Computer-Vision

I took [CS 639: Deep Learning for Computer Vision](https://sites.google.com/view/cs639spring2023dlcv) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison during the Spring 2023 semester, instructed by Professor [Yong Jae Lee](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~yongjaelee/). 

Here are the topics for each project:
* K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm
* Linear Classifier
* Fully Connected Networks
* Convolutional Networks
* FCOS: Fully Convolutional One-stage Object Detection
* Generative Adversarial Networks
* Style Transfer with SqueezeNet-based Diffusion Model
